1. Define what is ObjectId (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/#objectid) and what data it includes?

ObjectIds are small, likely unique, fast to generate, and ordered. 
ObjectId values are 12 bytes in length, consisting of:
    + A 4-byte timestamp, representing the ObjectId's creation, measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
    + A 5-byte random value generated once per process. This random value is unique to the machine and process.
    + A 3-byte incrementing counter, initialized to a random value.

If an integer value is used to create an ObjectId, the integer replaces the timestamp.

2. How do we set a field to an ObjectId type in Mongoose?
```typescript
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fieldName: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId }
});
```

3. How do we generate a new ObjectId in Mongoose?
```typescript
const newId = mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
```
